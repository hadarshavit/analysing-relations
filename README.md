# Code for Analyzing the Relations of Misclassified Inputs Between Models

## Abstract

A common belief in the machine learning community is that many of the mis-
classified images are “difficult” images (e.g., the differentiation between classes

is based on small details). We compare the misclassified images of various deep
learning models and check which model misclassifies which image. We find
that the misclassified images of each model are different. Moreover, despite
having similar accuracy on ImageNet, one model can classify correctly more
than 15% of the misclassified images of another model. This can encourage

further research to use two or more architectures when performing a predic-
tion, such as ensemble methods.
